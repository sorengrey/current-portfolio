# Heather Smith - Frontend Developer

![screenshot](./images/screenshot.png?raw=true "screenshot of home page")

Welcome! This website was created to showcase my favorite coding projects.<br>
<br>
Some of the projects are from Georgia Tech's Full Stack Flex Bootcamp, others are from Frontend Mentor, and there are a few sprinkled in that I did for fun.<br>
<br>
I am currently a frontend dev for [Excelerate America](http://www.excelerateamerica.com/), a group-purchasing website for small businesses.
