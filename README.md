# Heather Smith - Frontend Developer

![screenshot](./images/screenshot.png?raw=true "screenshot of home page")

Welcome! This website was created to showcase my favorite coding projects.
<br>
Some of the projects are from Georgia Tech's Full Stack Flex Bootcamp, others are from Frontend Mentor, and there are a few sprinkled in that I did for fun.
<br>
I am currently looking for my first job as a frontend developer. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, React, and more.
